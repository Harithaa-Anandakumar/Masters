For instance, an infant born in 1900 could expect to live upto 32.0 years (average life expectancy in 1900 globally) and the same number is 72.6 years for an infant born in 20191. In 1900, the top three causes of death were infectious diseases — flu (and pneumonia), tuberculosis and gastrointestinal infections2. Enormous improvements in public health, sanitation, medical inventions and treatments such as vaccines and antibiotics led to a sharp reduction in infectious diseases which now account for less than 20% of deaths globally. In the same time frame, there has been a significant increase in the proportion of deaths caused by more chronic, non-communicable diseases/conditions (NCD) (see Figure 1.2). Taken together, we see an aging population strained by NCDs of which cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most pronounced (see Figure 1.1). Almost half of the deaths attributed to CVDs are caused by heart failure (HF). Despite impressive improvements in modern medicine, pharmacological interventions are capable of only alleviating the symptoms of HF, rendering it a progressive and terminal disease. Currently, the overall survival rate at one, five and ten years after a diagnosis with heart failure is estimated to be 75.9%, 45.5% and 24.5% respectively3. It is estimated that 1-2% of the healthcare budget is spent on HF4, while the global economic burden is estimated at $108 billion per annum5 and in Germany the annual prevalence-based costs for heart failure patients are around €25,5326. The increasing proportions of the elderly in western societies as well as the developing nations following the trend, it is only expected that the incidence of HF would be on the rise. Yet, this debilitating and expensive disease’s only viable treatment in terms of long-term life quality and mortality is a heart transplant. However, as per one study7, 15% of patients died while waiting for a donor heart (at 180 days after listing), elucidating the severity of shortage of viable donor hearts. As of February 2020, there are a total of 1082 people on the heart transplant waitlist within the EuroZone as per Eurotransplant statistics8. Figure 1.1: Number of Deaths by Cause in the world in 2017. The graph shows the various causes of death in 2017 in the y-axis and the number of deaths per cause in the x-axis in millions. Cardiovascular diseases were responsible for most deaths (15M). Data from: Max Roser and Esteban Ortiz-Ospina (2019) – “Causes of Death”. Published online at OurWorldInData.org. Retrieved from: ‘https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death’ [Online Resource] Figure 1.2: Three Major Causes of Death. Graph shows an increase in percentage proportion of deaths over the last three decades due to non-communicable diseases and a parallel reduction in deaths due to communicable diseases. Although there are myriad causes of HF, such as isichemic heart disease, aortic or mitral regurtitation (volume stress), aortic or mitral stenosis (pressure stress), congenital cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, alcohol excess, anemia, thyrotoxicosis, septicemia, acromegaly, they all commonly operate through the central mechanism of reduced ventricular function9. Consequently, the heart is unable to adequately perfuse the tissues, resulting in a wide variety of clinical symptoms. Several compensatory measures are seen, for example, an initial phase of cardiac hypertrophy is seen to compensate for the loss of viable cardiomyocytes, resulting in a transient maintenance of the ejection fraction, sustainance of heart rate and blood pressure and thereby maintanence of organ perfusion. Over time, these remodelling mechanisms become detrimental and end up worsening the left ventricular function. In effect, a negative feed-forward pathophysiological loop governed by a dissonant neurohormonal system and imapaired calcium signalling is established in late-stage HF. Most of the pharamacological treatments currently available for HF (diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors aldosterone antagonists, etc) do not halt or address the underlying pathophysiology. Device therapies are currently the alternatives to pharmacological drugs. These include cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) which are implanted in severe cases as a means of primary or secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death. Ventricular assist device acts as a temporary bridge to a heart transplantation. Given this current scenario, it is vital to explore novel paths for the treatment and management of HF. 1.1 Need for better therapeutics Modern medicine has vastly improved the management of heart failure, yet it still remains a crippling disease that could immensely benefit from newer therapies. Adult human hearts are terminally differentiated and post-mitotic. A straight-forward approach in the treatment of HF would be to counteract the progressive loss of cardiomyocytes by supplementing the heart with fresh CMs10. This has been made possible largely due to the introduction of human embryonic11 and induced pluripotent stem cells 12. iPSCs are defined by their unlimited proliferation capacity and ability to differentiate into any given cell type (derivatives of all three germ layers) upon adequate stimuli. Effective and defined protocols of directed differentiation of various iPSCs to a cardiac lineage/cell fate (apart from various other cell types) have been developed and covered in the review13. The straight-forward approach of direct supplementation of CMs by an injection into the ventricular wall is fraught with its own key limitation: lack of long term engraftment of cardiomyocytes (varies based on the modality of delivery, covered below)14. Several other strategies to strenghten/remuscularize the heart such as, converting scar into muscle tissue by transdifferentiation15, inducing endogenous cardiomyocyte regeneration and proliferation16, and methods to save the remaining cardiomyocytes from cell death by modulating paracrine factors17 have been investigated (see Figure 1.3). Despite the limitation in long term engraftment, cardiomyocyte implantation remains the most plausible option from a translational and mechanisitic perspective. It is currently known that cardiomyocytes supplemented as a cell injection have the lowest retention and epicardial delivery of cardiomyocytes as tissue engineered patches show an improved retention18. Animal studies indicate that transplantation of engineered heart muscle (EHM), made from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCs), to a failing heart as a means of remuscularization showed improved cardiomyocyte proliferation, vascularization, unimpaired electrical coupling and improved left ventricular function. Additionally, these engineered patches have not shown to be associated with an increased propensity for arrhythmia19–21. More recently a macaque model of heart failure (with human-like cardiovascular physiology), showed near normal levels of contractile function after 3 months of transplantation of cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)22. Collectively, these preclinical studies hold promise for the utilization of cardiomyocytes and EHMs thereby derived as a potential therapeutic source for failing human hearts. Figure 1.3: Delivery Strategies of iPSC-CMs and Treatment Options for Heart Failure. Production of EHMs start with isolating primary differentiated cells (e.g, fibroblasts) which are then dedifferentiated to iPSCs followed by redifferentiation to CMs and stromal cells, which are then combined in a collagen matrix forming the EHM. 1.1.1 Immunological Responses in Transplantations Fully personalized cell therapy using autologous iPSCs for implantation circumvents problems associated with immune rejection. Yet, the cost and duration of obtaining clinical-grade iPSC cell lines along with their differentiation into required cell type for transplantation and verification of safety and efficacy have hampered autologous iPSC technology to move into clinical practice23,24. Allogenic transplantation1 of thoroughly characterized iPSCs seems to be a more plausible approach to cell therapy25. Histocompatibility remains the main problem of using allogenic cells and tissues, including the ones that are derived as a result of iPSC differentiation. Roughly 20,000 HLA alleles are known www.ebi.ac.uk/imgt/hla/. This polymorphism is the reason why appropriate selection of donors for transplantation is crucial and difficult. A perfect donor match is unlikely, and there is always some degree of mismatch between the recipient’s and donor’s major histocompatility complex (MHC) genes necessitating the systemic administration of immunosuppressive drugs. To circumvent these problems, an HLA-haplotype bank of pluripotent stem cell lines was proposed to establish efficiently chosen samples with sufficient HLA diversity to provide a reasonable HLA match for a large percentage of the target population26. For instance, a cell bank of 30 iPSC cell lines would enable to find a three-locus match in 82.2% of the Japanese population27. These numbers vary depending on the diversity of the population and inspite of these optimistic forecasts, such HLA haplotype banks may not completely prevent allogenic rejection as the minor mH antigens will still be inevitably different in unrelated donors and interactions of innate immunity is not accounted for28. An alternative strategy is the creation of an universal stem cell line by excision of highly polymorphic HLA class Ia and II molecules from iPSCs29. Once such cell-lines are authorized for clinical applications, using them to produce CMs and resultant EHMs would be feasible without drastic changes to the current protocols, allowing for faster and robust production of EHMs as a therapeutic option. 1.2 Engineered Human Myocardium Engineered human myocardium is composed of human cardiomyocytes and supportive stromal cells both of which can by obtained by targeted differentiation from iPSCs using serum-free, GMP-compliant media and protocols. Differentiated cells are combined in an optimized ratio, embedded into a collagen matrix and casted (see Figure 1.4). Several EHM patches may be stacked to make a muscle layer of optimum thickness that is sutured onto a failing myocardium to assist mechanically in pumping. For translation to clinics a production protocol that is compliant with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) is required30. Figure 1.4: Various sizes of EHMs for clinical and experimental applications. Source: Tiburcy et al, 2017. 1.2.1 cGMP and Quality Control of Tissue Engineered Products Tissue engineered products (TEPs) are defined as “products developed for structural and functional repair of tissue/organ defects and their mode of action is to repair, restore or replace tissue structure/function”31. Any cGMP facility accredited for the manufacturing of TEPs is designed and organized according to the Good Manufacturing Practice for Pharmaceutical Manufactures complying with their quality assurance and quality control norms, all of which fall under an established Quality System approach that regulates all aspects of the collection, processing, storage and release of cell therapy products. The Quality System approach is that of a risk-based approach and hence it is of paramount importance to reduce the risk of potential contamination, both microbiological and cross contamination with other products from the same production plant. It is for this reason the Chapters 2.6.1, 2.6.27, 2.6.12 or 2.6.13 of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur) are dedicated to the various procedures of testing for microbial contamination that needs to be abided under a cGMP protocol32. This is because TEPs are engineered from live donor cells which can not be subjected to a sterilization process and may carry infective agents either on the cell surface or intra-cytoplasmic. They may also harbour latent infective agents integrated in the genome. The media and physical conditions used to manipulate and store the cells are by definition suited for survival and growth of certain tissues, but this could also allow for the latent and insidious growth of microbes. The methods currently in place for microbial testing involve inoculating the products in different media suitable for the growth of common aerobic and anaerobic growth of bacteria (Chapter 2.6.1 of Ph. Eur) where the growth of microbes is detected using turbidity as a measure or detected using the measure of carbon dioxide production (Chapter 2.6.27 of Ph. Eur). These are commonly known as sterility tests and although extensive, do not capture all possible bacterial contaminants that could thrive in the cellular growth media. Newer methods such as Rapid Microbiological Methods (RMM) are detection systems which yield equivalent or better results than conventional (microbiological) methods, in lesser time. In this context, an interesting possibility is to explore the potential microbial contamination using high-throughput sequencing data. 1.3 RNA Sequencing Information stored in genes as DNA is transcribed into RNA and ultimately translated into proteins. This is the central dogma of biology. The transcription of a subset of genes into RNA molecules gives a cell it’s specificity and identity, along with regulating its activities. The term ‘Transcriptome’ refers to the total transcribed RNA at a given timepoint, whether from a population of cells or a single cell, and its analysis is known as transcriptomics. Microarrays, a hybridization based approach, were the mainstay of such transcriptomics until the recent advent of high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) which revolutionized transcriptomics by enabling RNA analysis via the sequencing of complementary cDNA33. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has several advantages over microarrays, namely its ability to detect transcripts that are not yet annotated, low background signal, a large dynamic range of expression level, higher sensitivity, all of which allow for understanding the dynamic and complex nature of the transcriptome. The type of information that RNA-Seq provides can be broadly classified into two categories: Qualitative data which includes identifying transcripts, identifying intron/extron boundaries, poly-A sites and transcriptional start sites (TSS) which in RNA-Seq terminology is commonly referred to as “annotation”. Quantitative data which includes measuring differences in expression, alternative TSS, alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation between two or more treatments or groups. This power of sequencing RNA has led to RNA-Seq not only being limited to the genomics community but also to it becoming a mainstay in the toolkit of all life science research communities. A typical RNA-Seq experiment can be split into three parts34: Pre Analysis Wet-Lab (Designing the project, RNA extraction, purification and enrichment of mRNA, cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, adaptor ligation and amplification, cDNA libraries to be sequenced) Experimental Design (choosing the library type, sequencing legth, the number of replicates and sequencing depth). In the most common use-case of RNA-Seq analysis which is differential expression studies, two or more groups / conditions are defined. In this project, each differentiation run that produced CMs from iPSCs can be considered as a separate group. Sequencing Design (spike-ins, randomization at library prep, randomization at sequencing run) Quality Control (raw reads, read alignment, quantification, reproducibility) Core Analysis Transcriptomic Profiling (read alignment, transcript discovery, quantification level, quantification measure) Normalization (Z-scale, variance stabilized transformation, etc) Differential Expression Analysis Advanced Analysis Interpretation (functional profiling) Visualization Integration (eQTL, ATAC-seq, ChIP-Seq, proteomics/metabolomics) The success of an RNA-Seq study depends on the choices and decisions made at each of these steps. 1.3.1 Single cell versus bulk RNA Seq A single mammalian cell contains typically less than 1pg or 400K molecules of mRNA. The RNA to be sequenced may be collected from samples containing either multiple (bulk) or single cells. Data obtained from the more established bulk sequencing represents the average expression level for each gene across the large population of input. This bulk RNA-Seq which is the main work horse of gene expression studies is adequate for comparative transcriptomics, wherein samples of the same tissue are compared across species, or for quantifying expression signatures from ensembles, such as in disease studies. However, it falls short in its ability to be an effective tool for studying heterogeneous systems, such as complex tissues (brain, heart, etc) or early developmental studies. It also fails to capture the stochastic nature of gene expression and spatial resolution can not be obtained, as ilustrated in 1.5. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) addressess these issues as it measures the distribution of expression levels for each gene across a population of cells35. Even in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, which was considered to be well-studied and all potential cell types involved were known, scRNA-seq has revealed a new and unkown cell type, the ionocyte36. Spatially resolved scRNA-Seq holds similar promises, revealing novel information on the extent of fetal marker gene expression in small populations of adult heart tissues37. Thus, novel biological questions addressing cell type identification, heterogeneity of cell responses, stochasticity of gene expression and inference of gene regulatory networks across cells can be studied. The applications of scRNA-Seq to novel biological questions and the computational and laboratory methods catering to it are advancing at such a rapid pace that even recent reviews38,39 are becoming outdated. Figure 1.5: Example of Bulk and Single-Cell RNA-Seq. If a population of cells or tissue is considered, it can be sequenced either at the population/bulk level or the single-cell level (For simplicity, different coloured cells represent different sub-populations/cell-types within the sample). If the bulk analysis pathway is chosen, post-sequencing, for any arbitrary gene (here denoted as Gene 1), a single average expression level is measured, and subsequently is representative of a mixed cell population (a grey cell — combination of all the colored cells). On the otherhand, if the same population were to be sequenced using Single-Cell technologies, then each of these hypothetical cell types would record its own level of gene expression for the same arbitrary Gene 1, and this would allow to better understand the heterogenous tissue. Illustration of Computational Deconvolution in the inner grey box. Based on the type of sequencing there is either a bulk gene expression profile for the entire population (a single grey profile) or distinct single cell profiles (shown by different coloured peaks accounting for the different cell types). The single cell profiles can be used to make a cell signature matrix wherein distinct set of genes are expressed by different cell types (a simplistic example of 5 genes and 4 cell types is shown). The idea of deconvolution is that with a signature matrix and a bulk GEP, the putative proportions of cell types within the bulk sample (denoted as cell concentrations) can be estimated, given that the scRNA-Seq is representative of the population of the Bulk RNA-Seq 1.4 Computational deconvolution The usage of scRNA-Seq is still limited by its cost and impracticality with respect to analyses of large sample cohorts. Also, most clinical specimens are fixed, for example in formalin or embedded in paraffin, which renders its dissociation into intact single-cells impossible. To circumvent these limitations and utilize the specificity and accuracy of scRNA-Seq along with the ease of bulk of RNA-Seq, several groups have developed deconvolution computational techniques40–46. Deconvolution, in the realm of sequencing, is a common umbrella term for a procedure that estimates the proportion of each cell type in a bulk sample. Flow cytometry and scRNA-Seq are experimental methods of deconvolution. Computational deconvolution leverages scRNA-Seq reference sets (or fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-sorted, purified bulk sets) for bulk gene expression deconvolution. Of various tools developed to perform deconvolution, CIBERSORTx47 became probably the most versatile because unlike other methods it can: Leverage scRNA-Seq derived reference profiles for bulk tissue dissection Overcome technical variation arising from different platforms (eg., bulk RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, microarrays) and tissue preservation techniques Digitally “purify” cell-type specific expression profiles from bulk tissues without physical cell isolation. Briefly, most deconvolution algorithms, including CIBERSORTx, work to solve the following linear equations for f: \\[m = Hf\\] m: mixture gene expression profile (GEP) (to be deconvolved) f: a vector of fraction of each cell type in a signature matrix (the unknown) H: a signature matrix containing signature genes for cell subsets of interest Both m and H are input requirements. Further explanation of deconvolution and the implementaion of the algorithms can be found at47,48. With this framework, a relevant single-cell or bulk-sorted RNA sequencing data can be used to tease out molecular signatures of distinct cell types and these signatures can then be used to characterize cellular heterogeneity from bulk tissue transcriptomes without physical cell isolation, see 1.5. 1.5 Exploratory Data Analysis in RNA-Sequencing High-throughput gene expression technologies have become a common choice for addressing systems-level and as well as molecular questions of biological phenomena. Yet, these approaches do not always meet the high expectations of the sequencing revolution, possibly due to the fact that the interpretation of the data is often lagging behind its generation. As discussed by Hudson et al.,49 in their opinion article, the rampant usage of small/curated lists of differentially expressed (DE) genes are limiting and can possibly lead to misinterpretation or out-of-context conclusions. Unbiased exploratory data analysis techniques requir holistic interpretation of the data. Common techniques include unsupervised clustering (hierarchical, k-means, etc) and dimension reduction (discussed below), which are used to detect unbiased/unpredicted patterns, confounding variables.2 Exploratory data analysis not only helps to find new ways of answering questions but it ultimately permits to detect unexpected patterns and formulate novel working hypotheses. 1.5.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) High-dimensional data are common in today’s biology as they arise when several features, like the expression of many genes, are measured for multiple samples. This kind of data holds several challenges such as high computational demand and an increased error rate due to multiple test corrections when testing each feature for association with an outcome. PCA is an unsupervised dimension reduction technique, that on any given dataset performs linear transformation and fits the data to a new coordinate system in such a way that maximum variance is explained by the first coordinate, and each subsequent coordinate is orthogonal to the last and explains progressively lesser variance. Each principal component (PC) thus sums up a certain percentage of the total variation in the dataset. In this way, a set of x correlated variables over y samples is transformed to a set of p uncorrelated principal components over the same samples. Where many variables correlate with one another, they contribute strongly to the same principal component. PCA can find patters without prior knowledge about whether samples come from different treatment groups or have phenotypic differences. The first few principal components lend themselves to low-dimensional representation (eg, bi-plot) of the data, while retaining as much information as possible as they represent a large portion of the relevant information in the dataset while uncorrelated noise is pushed to the last components. An example of the application of this method can be found in Witteveen et al.’s article50. The authors performed an observational study aiming to investigate the value of early systemic inflammation in predicting ICU-acquired weakness. Systemic inflammation can be represented by a variety of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor and interferon gamma. These cytokines are correlated with each other, and incorporation of them into a regression model will result in significant collinearity. One type of cytokine is regarded as one dimension, and there are dozens of dimensions in the original dataset. In the study, the authors employed PCA to reduce the dimension. They found that the variance of these ten cytokines can be accounted for by three PCs. As a result, the model was remarkably simplified. The goal is to reduce the features’ dimensionality with minimal loss of information, for a simplistic example see Figure 1.6. Figure 1.6: Illustration of PCA. Given two variables A and B, the plot on the left shows a scatter plot in its original place while the one on the right shows a PCA bi-plot of the variables. In this simplistic example, a 2D object (with 2 variables) which was not efficiently separated in 1D representation its original space is separated clearly in 1D across it’s first PC. Here, 2D is efficiently reduced to 1D with minimal loss of information, this same technique can be applied to several dimensions to efficiently reduce it to smaller dimensions and be easily visualized. 1.6 Rationale for the current work Targeted differentiation of hypoimmunogenic iPSCs into functional cell types and subsequent assembly into artificial tissues for organ repair and replacement holds great potential to overcome the current donor organ shortage. Translation into clinics requires rigorous control and constant refinement of all processes involved. RNA sequencing offers an in-depth view into the state of a cell (scRNA-seq) or a cell population (bulk RNA-Seq), and is ideally suited to describe the evolution of iPSCs along transient, morphologically not fully characterized states towards a terminally differentiated cell. The two other areas relevant to this project, namely, fundamental knowledge about differentiation and refinement of differentiation protocols, have been vastly improved by the usage of sequencing technologies13,51–55. Wu et al56,57 for instance, evaluated current protocols to generate kidney organoids from hiPSCs (as source for tissue replacement) using scRNA-Seq. The study showed that the organoid-derived cell types were immature, and contained a significant percentage of non-renal cells. This proof-of-concept study showed the power of scRNA-Seq technologies to characterize and improve organoid differentiation. Prof. Zimmermann’s research group has developed GMP compliant protocols for the differentiation of hiPSC to cardiomyocytes and stromal cells which are then used to make EHMs intended for tissue replacement therapy. Currently scRNA-Seq is not available but multiple bulk RNA-Seq data across several differentiation runs have been performed by the group. The availability of bulk RNA-Seq data and public reference scRNA-Seq data sets like that of Friedman et al58 along with accessible deconvolution techniques, like CIBERSORTx, allows within the project to characterize hiPSC induced cardiomyocytes and EHM at a sub-population level based on transcriptomic data.

Briefly, the analysis of RNA-Seq started with assessing the quality of raw sequencing data as fastq files using FASTQC (v0.11.4). Once the quality was deemed fit for further processing, the fastq files were mapped to GRCh38/hg38 using HISAT2 (v2.1.0), resulting in BAM files. The coordinate sorted BAM files were then indexed using SAMTOOLS (v1.9). The number of reads assigned to each feature of the genome was estimated using FeatureCounts of SUBREAD module (v1.6.3) with Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.96.chr.gtf as the reference genome .gtf file. The alignment, indexing and abundance estimation were performed on the GWDG-high performance computing (HPC) cluster. Count text files were imported into R (v3.6.1) running under macOS Mojave 10.14.5 for further processing. The data was normalized to either Z-scale or variable stabilized normalization in R using the DESeq2 package’s (v1.25.10) vst() function. PCA plots were made using R’s base function prcomp(). The visualization was performed using the ggplot2 package (v3.2.1). Several other packages and few custom functions were used throughout this project. The bash and R scripts can be found here, along with the output from sessionInfo() from R. Figure 3.1: Basic analysis pipeline for Bulk RNA-Seq data used in this project. Briefly, raw sequenced data input as fastq files are run through FASTQC for basic quality checks, after which depending on the quality it either goes through additional steps of quality control or directly to an alignment tool like that of HISAT2. An optional post-alignment, quality control check exists, after which abundance of the transcripts is estimated using a tool such as FeatureCounts. This gived the raw read counts file which needs to then be normalized and then used for further analysis.

For the current work we used reference data obtained by Friedman et al58 who investigated cardiac differentiation of human pluripoten stem cells and performed single-cell transcriptomic analyses to map fate changes and analyze gene expression patterns during the differentation processes in vitro. In this approach 5 distinct time points were sequenced, namely, on days 0 (hiPSC), 2 (germ layer specification), 5 (progenitor cell), 15 (committed cardiac derivative) and 30 (definitive cardiac derivative) of their differentiation protocol. Relevant to this project are the last two timepoints — day 15 and day 30. Single-cell count data was downloaded from the ArrayExpress database maintained by EMBL-EBI, using the accession number E-MTAB-6268. CIBERSORTX47 reads a single cell reference input with each single-cell (every column) labelled according to the cell’s phenotype or cluster identifier and bulk data with samples as columns and rownames as genes in both cases. 3.2.1 Processing of Single Cell Data To create the reference file, clustering and de novo identification of cell types from scRNA data was performed according to Friedman et al’s paper58. Briefly, the outlier genes and cells (outside 3x median absolute deviation) of the number of cells with detected genes, mitochondrial reads, ribosomal genes were filtered out. Post filtering, scran (1.12.1) package was used for cell-to-cell normalization without quickClustering option. PCA and clustering was performed using ascend package (v0.9.93), following the same parameters as the paper. The differentially expressed genes between the clusters were then calculated by the runDiffExpression() from ascend package. Friedman et al identified two clusters at each of the last two time points. At Day 15, they define two sub-populations — non-contractile (d15:S1) and committed CM (cCM) (d15:S2) and likewise at Day 30 — non-contractile (d30:S1) and definitive CM (dCM) (d30:S2). To verfiy the steps followed so far and validate the reliable reproduction of the paper, gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes within the sub clusters was performed. Figure 3.2 confirms that the clusters are consistent with the ones described by Friedman et al. Figure 3.2: scRNA-Seq Reference Dataset. Post-processing and before feeding it into CIBERSORTx, the reference data set was analyzed to ensure its reliable reproduction of the sub-groups as defined by the paper. Here, at both time points there is a sub-group which is enriched for non-contractile features and another for cardiomyocyte features. The size of the circle corresponds to the fold enrichment observed. Reproduction of Figure 2 (J and M) from Friedman 2018. CIBERSORTX is an online tool with user-friendly GUI with detailed tutorials on the developer’s webpage. Firstly, a signature matrix was created using this single cell reference file using the Create Signature Matrix function using scRNA-Seq as the input data type and all other settings were left at default. In the second step of deconvolution analysis, mode is set to Impute Cell Fractions and under Custom mode, the previously run signature matrix file is chosen from the drop down menu and a mixture file, previously uploaded bulk RNA-Seq data, is chosen. The option enable batch correction was used with B-Mode, which is advised for removing technical differences between the platforms used for the signature and bulk matrices. Finally, for the permutations for significance analysis option, the most stringent, 1000 option was chosen. 3.3 Analysis of Rhesus RNA-Seq The bulk in-house samples from Rhesus were mapped using HISAT2 with default parameters. There was no indexed reference genome readily available, so the entire genome was downloaded in from USCS Genome Browser — rheMac10 assembly and converted from 2bit format to Fasta format using twoBitToFa available at USCS. Post alignment, abundance estimation was performed using the FeatureCounts tool which requires a valid .gtf file. The file was prepared using the following commands: #Download wget -c -O mm9.refGene.txt.gz filePathLinked #Unzip the file and download the genePredToGtf tool from ucsc cut -f 2- rheMac10.refGene.txt &gt; refGene.input ./genePredToGtf file refGene.input rheMac10refGene.gtf cat rheMac10refGene.gtf | sort -k1,1 -k4,4n &gt; rheMac10refGene.gtf.sorted This rheMac10refGene.gtf.sorted file was used as the input .gtf file for FeatureCounts. This outputs the raw counts file of the Rhesus macaque sample mapped to it’s own genome. To make comparisons with the human RNA-Seq samples relevant, orthologous genes between the two species were determined and only those with 1:1 orthology were used for further analysis. Orthologous genes were obtained from ensembl-biomart. The gene lengths of each gene was used for both species as a means of normalization within DESEQ2 by adding a matrix of gene lengths within the assays(dds)[[&quot;avgTxLength&quot;]] &lt;- geneLengthMatrix slot. 3.4 Estimating Bacterial and Viral Contaminants DecontaMiner64 was used to estimate the possible bacterial and viral contaminants in a representative subset of bulk samples of this project. Briefly, the unmapped reads i.e., those that failed to map to the reference genome were collected in a separate directory and mapped to bacterial and viral reads using the genome databases (NCBI nt) using MegaBLAST algorithm, specifying the number of allowed mismatches/gaps and the alignment length. The BLAST databases have been curated by downloading the sequences of the complete genomes from the RefSeq repository. These .fasta files were assembled into blast databases by running the makeblastdb command. Files containing discarded reads along the pipeline are also generated — the low quality ones, ones mapped to mtRNA/rRNA and ambiguous and unaligned reads. The second part of the pipeline, involves setting a match count threshold (MCT) — minimum number of reads successfully mapped to a single organism to consider it a contaminant. This parameter was set at 100 (default is 5). The pipeline once run results in a table containing all the matches satisfying the alignment criteria. References "],

Figure 4.1: A General RNA-Seq Workflow. In general the source material of RNA-Seq is a sample either from patients, cell culture or tissues. After RNA extraction and optional enrichment, they get sequenced at a general sequencing (core) facility. This results in the generation of large files which are transferred to a HPC, where the first steps of alignment and abundance estimation is performed. Smaller count text files containing information on the transcripts and the quanitative amount of expression can then be easily stored in a local database for retrieval and further processing. The final steps of performing the required analysis specific for the question asked can be performed on any statistical environment (such as R) and visualized and deployed for publishing or internal use. Throughout this whole process it is vital to maintain a consistent and common, easy to use metadata collection system. Shapes and their meanings: cylinders (database), rhombus (decision points), rectangles (processes), oval (starting/ending points). The average alignment for uniquely mapped reads is ~70% across all samples used in this study, while the number of reads assigned to specific genomic coordinates by featureCounts abundance estimation tool is on average ~60%. These fall within normal acceptable ranges. There were no excessive adaptor content or duplicated reads observed. 4.2 Exploring Potential Microbial Contamination using RNA-Seq Data To explore the potential microbial contaminants amongst the sample data sets, a representative subset of samples were chosen, see Table 4.1, such that every category i.e., adult heart, fetal heart, CM, EHM is represented by one sample in the subset, chosen across different sequencing runs, different years and different projects. Human and non-human reads were separated and the latter were used as possible microbial read candidates. After a series of filtering, as explained in Section 3.4, the non-host, high-quality and unique reads were aligned against the reference genomes of bacteria and virus.

Samples vary in terms of their sequencing depth (akin to the total reads column) and the proportion mapped to the human genome, which varies between 40% to 91% across samples. A large variance is found in the number of viral/bacterial reads mapped per million human mapped reads, see Figure 4.2B. Figure 4.2: General Mapping Statistics. A shows samples and percentage of reads mapped to different groups. Y-aixs is in log scale to resolve low-expression reads. B shows shows separate bacterial and viral reads mapped per million human mapped reads per sample. Absolute numbers of reads confidently assigned to different viral species across different samples is shown in Figure 4.3A. The same data is shown as relative abundance in Figure 4.3B. Samples 1 and 2 have a disproportionate number of reads, about 20,000 reads, mapped to a single viral genome — the col phage or phi-X174 (PhiX - NC_00 1422.1). Proteus phage is the second entity with high number of absolute reads assigned to it (~7000). Figure 4.3: Possible viral contaminants. A shows the absolute number of reads confidently assigned to different viral species across different samples, while B represents them as relative abundances. PhiX contaminants in samples 1 and 2 are most probably delibrately added as spike-in in illumina HISEQ platforms to increase nucleotide diversity. Samples 1 and 2 were sequenced on the HISEQ-250063 and HISEQ-400061 platforms while all in-house samples were sequenced on HISEQ-200030 which has a separate, dedicated lane for the PhiX spike-in quality control to avoid PhiX reads to appear in the FASTQ files.3 Unusually high numbers of viral reads were seen in Sample 7, mostly that of Proteus phage VB_PmiS-Isfahan (NC_041925). Like other phage viruses, the Proteus phage also infects bacterial cells, specifically Proteus mirabilis a highly motile bacterium belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family, which is the most common species responsible for catheter-associated urinary tract infections65. No reads were confidently assigned to the Proteus genera of bacteria, however, proteus phage is considered to be highly lytic and there are several other bacteria belonging to the Proteus genera which are ubiquitously present on and in human guts which could be infected by the phage66, hence making this assignment plausible. All other viruses detected were less 200 reads per sample except those that mapped to the HERVs. These are viral sequences that represent ancient viral infections that affected the primates’ germ line and became stably integrated into the host genome. This was an interesting find as ~ 8% of the human genome is said to be of viral origin, the HERVs. The reason behind its baseline expression in most of the adult tissues nor its role in different pathologies are not well defined67–69. Figure 4.4: Possible bacterial contaminants at the Genus level. A shows the absolute number of reads confidently assigned to different bacterial genera across different samples, accounting for around 80 percent of all the reads assigned to bacteria, while B represents them as percentage proportions. Unlike viral, the bacterial reads were analyzed at two levels, genus (Figure 4.4) and species (Figure 4.5). The 10 genera shown account for about ~80% of all reads mapped to bacteria while the 10 species shown account for about ~50% of all reads mapped. All samples except Sample 6, are within acceptable limits of bacterial reads/sample, less than 100 bacterial reads/million human mapped reads70. Sample 6 has ~13500 reads in absolute numbers and approximately 250 bacterial reads/million human mapped reads, most of which are accounted for by 4 genera — Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Neisseria, Pseudomonas. This is also reflected at the species level, where Klebsiella pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae account for 57% of the entire bacterial contamination found in the sample while the rest is accounted for by 189 other species. Low levels of both these bacteria are also found in the other in-house samples. The presence of Cutibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter bacterial contamination has been well documented owing to their epidermal persence in the first case and to water associated presence, even ultra-purified, in the last two cases71–73. While Klebsiella has been associated with pathologies, it is also a known opportunistic pathogen which is a normal part of the microbial flora of mucosal surfaces such as the mouth and throat and found ubiquitously in nature/environment74. Likewise, although Neisseria gonorrhoeae is not a part of the normal flora, it could also present as benign/unnoticed infections of the mucosal surfaces urogenital tract, pharynx, and rectum, apart from causing a full-blown pathological disease75. The discovery of bacterial reads in cell line data and the finding of different bacterial taxa in data from different sequencing runs/groups/labs supports the idea that a good portion of bacterial reads are possibly not derived from the specimens themselves. Figure 4.5: Possible bacterial contaminants at the species level. A shows the absolute number of reads confidently assigned to different bacterial species across different samples, accounting for around 50 percent of all the reads assigned to bacteria, while B represents them as percentage proportions. The results from these 7 representative samples are in-line with papers published which looked at the microbial contamination in RNA-Seq samples in terms of their diversity and the range of proportions of microbial contamination differing between different samples. For instance, work by Strong et al70, showed that Acinetobacter contributed to the highest number of reads. While the study by Park et al76, also picked up a large number of samples having PhiX phage reads in them. All the samples assessed here have microbial reads less than 0.1% of total reads (including the first two samples if we account for the spike-in PhiX reads). This is considered very low and acceptible by other papers which have published on this topic70, however, no rule/regulation stipulated by cGMP exists currently which deal with such non-standard exploration of microbial contamination in TEPs. The samples also differed in their sequencing depths which would have influenced the extent to which metagenomic reads were picked up. This work is neither exhaustive nor confirmatory but since it has the possibility of working on already collected data, it could be a novel complementary and regulatory step that might one day be incorporated into a cGMP practice alongside other standard microbial detection techniques. 4.3 Global view of the transcriptomic data Data from 68 samples were collected (20 iPSC-CMs, 17 EHM, 16 Fetal Heart samples, 15 Adult Heart Samples) across different studies as shown in Table 3.1. To examine global trends in gene expression levels, the normalized data across all samples were visualized using PCA (Figure 4.7). 72.4% of total variation in the dataset can be explained by the first 4 PCs and the cumulative percentage of the variances explained by the first eight PCs is shown as a scree plot (Figure 4.6A). The major source of variation in the data is correlated with the sample type and is captured by the first PC accounting for 42.9% of the variation in the data set, where the first PC effectively separates the sub-groups with an almost uni-directional progression from cardiomyocytes to EHMs to fetal heart tissue and adult heart subtypes, showing that this vector captures the increase in complexity of the tissue types (Figure 4.6B). Figure 4.6: A shows the cummulative variance explained by the PCs. B and C show the different groups plotted against PC1 and PC2 respectively. The second largest source of variation is captured by PC2 accounting for 14.3% of the total variance and separates the fetal heart samples from the rest of the sample types as shown by the ordering of sample types according to PC2, (see Figure 4.6C). Figure 4.7: A and B show the PCA plots of all the samples againt PC1 and PC2/PC4. The samples are coloured based on their groups. Cardiomyocyte samples which are &gt;90% actinin+ in FACS are in-essence representative of a single cell type, while EHMs have the additional stromal cells. Apart from these two, fetal heart tissues also contain a variety of other cell types and sub-types including differentiated and differentiating cells along different lineages. The adult heart on the other hand is composed of not just cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts but also endothelial cells, immune cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and cells making up the conduction system. Fetal heart samples show relatively loose clustering compared to adult heart samples. This might be because the fetal samples were collected across different gestational periods, in the range of 9 weeks - 16 weeks (Figure 4.7A). The EHM samples also show two semi-distinct clusters, corresponding to the two EHM sources — in-house and from the PRJNA362579 project. The source of this variation within the EHM samples appears to be strongly associated with PC4, see Figures 4.8 and 4.7B. Figure 4.8: Separation of EHMs by the first 4 PCs. The two groups of EHMs and the varying degress of separation by different PCs, visualized by a density plot. As explained in Section 1.5.1, the loading scores of genes can be explored further to look for possible meaningful explanations of the basis of separations of the clusters. The top 50 genes with the highest absolute loading values is tabulated for the first 4 PCs in Table 4.3.

The genes discriminatory for the adult heart samples not only account for the mature adult cardiomycoytes but also for the other cell types primarily found in adult hearts biopsies like AQP7, possibly from the adipose tissue surrounding the heart77 and APOD from aortic valves of the adult heart78. These cell types would be atypical for bioengineered tissues and cultured cell and less common in the fetal heart samples. The current analysis pipeline, does not allow to quantify the relative closeness of the EHM groups to either fetal or adult phenotypes. Other biological and functional characterizations of the EHMs are necessary to complement the deconvolution approach. 4.3.1 Correlation amongst groups Pearson correlation of cardiomyocytes, EHMs and fetal heart samples’ gene expression to that of adult heart based on the top 2000 genes with the highest absolute loadings in PC1 and PC2 was performed, to check for global similarity in expression patterns and is shown in Figure 4.9 A.2. These complement the observations from PCA and show that fetal heart samples have the highest similarity to adult heart samples (median ~0.6, with a notable range of 0.3 - 0.65), followed by EHMs (median ~0.45) and lastly by cardiomyocytes (median ~0.25). By choosing ~380 genes which are specifically detectable and enriched in the human heart, based on Human Protein Atlas data, the pearson correlation of the EHM and fetal samples becomes very comparable as shown in Figure 4.9 B.2. The median correlation of the EHM samples is even slightly higher than that of the fetal samples, which is in line with our estimation of the EHMs being comparable to (~13wk) fetal tissue79. Gene expression across different sample types as per the curated gene list appears to be more consistent and comparable, as visualized in Figure 4.9 B.1 in comparison to Figure 4.9 A.1. The genes in the heatmaps are hierarchically clustered. These results show that the separation in PC1 of all the different groups are possibly not due to differences in the expression of genes pertaining to CMs, as they all have a higher correlation when a subset of heart-specific genes was used. And this high correlation was lost when the top 2000 genes with the highest loading in PC1 was used, indicating that the highest variance amongst the groups is possibly not due to biological differences in their CMs expression profile. Figure 4.9: Correlation of samples. Heatmaps show VST normalized and group-wise clubbed data. A.1 shows the top 2000 genes with highest loading in PC1 and PC2. B.1 shows a heatmap drawn from a selection of ~380 genes based on Human Protein Atlas. In both the heatmaps each row represents a gene and each column represents the average of the sample group. A.2 and B.2 show the pearson correlation of the different groups to the adult heart samples based on either the top 2000 genes or the curated 380 genes. 4.3.2 Gene-level analysis Despite crucial insights derived from the global view of samples, a view based on curated set of genes are also indispensible and remain one of the most common ways of comparing samples/groups using transcriptomic data. Here we selected four different groups of genes, covering an example of metabolic, structural and general gene lists as shown in Figure 4.10. Panel A is a selected representation of the 10 highest and most specifically expressed genes based on information from human protein atlas. Unsurprisingly the adult heart samples show the highest expression for these genes, except the Myom1 gene which has been recently found to be a putative marker for hPSC-induced cardiomyocytes’ maturity80, which is almost equally expressed in all samples. Panel B consists of 22 genes associated with the sarcomere gene ontology term. Genes such as Myo3b, Capn3 have a lower expression in the adult heart samples as opposed to the others and are known to have distinct patterns of high expressions during the developmental timeline81,82. Panel C is representative of the genes belonging to the oxidation-reduction pathway, while D is a gene list derived from the group’s prior publication which deduced that these 50 genes are differentially expressed and considered to be markers for cardiomyocytes. Notably, adult heart associated genes are generally highly expressed, followed by fetal and EHM samples. A few clear exceptions are genes such as Gpc3 which has a clear and marked role in vertebrate development83, Myl4 and Myl7 are known to be expressed heavily by the developing heart84–86, and Tnni3 which is known to be expressed under specific developmental conditions87. This gives a snapshot of the approximate level of general (panel A and D), structural (panel B) and metabolic (panel C) maturation/status of the EHMs and cardiomyocytes at a transcript level in comparison to the fetal and adult heart samples. These observations are in line with previous results showing that cardiomyocytes in 2D are less mature than EHMs and at a population/tissue level the EHMs are similar to fetal heart samples. Figure 4.10: At individual gene level, the EHMs resemble the fetal heart expression levels. The graph shows normalized counts of different panels of gene sets. The bigger circles show the median of each group while the slightly transparent and smaller circles represent each sample for every gene. A shows the 10 highest and most specifically expressed genes as per human protein atlas. B contains 22 genes belonging to the sarcomere gene ontology term. C is representative of the genes belonging to the oxidation-reduction pathway and D is a gene list derived from the group’s prior publication which deduced that these 50 genes are differentially expressed and considered to be markers for cardiomyocytes Exploring the data in the global context and at the gene-level did fortify pre-formed opinions but was of little help in the elucidation of the possible sub-populations within each sample. This was subsequently addressed by the deconvolution technique, as described below. 4.4 Deconvolution of Bulk CMs and EHMs RNA-Seq Data Adult and fetal primary heart samples are natively heterogeneous with respect to cell composition, while bioengineered tissues consist of two main components and samples from targeted differentiations should contain one dominant cell type at beginning (iPSC) and end (CM) but go through stages with diverse transient cell populations in between. To rationalize and quantify the heterogeneity present within the in-house bulk samples, computational deconvolution was performed using a public single-cell reference sample58. Based on the reference data, the last two time points sequenced during the differentiation of iPSCs to CMs are represented as Day 15 and Day 30 with two distinct sub-populations within each group. Day 15 is characterized by a non-contractile, fibroblast-like sub-group (denoted as d15:S1) and a contractile, cardiac-like/cCM sub-group (denoted as d15:S2). Similarly day 30 is characterized by two sub-groups — non-contractile cells (d30:S1) and cardiomyocytes/dCM (d30:S2) ), as tabulated in B of 4.11. Methodologically we followed a state of the art protocol, as described in Section 3.2, where d15 and d30 reference data were processed and used in CIBERSORTx to generate a signature-matrix, which was then used to deconvolve the bulk samples, whose results are shown as a percentage proportion bar graph in Figure 4.11A. CMs samples are considered highly (&gt;90% cardiomyocytes) pure while EHM samples were prepared from 70% cardiomyocytes and 30% stromal cells (~30%). To scale the CM samples for the 30% FBs in the EHM sample, a “virtual” cell type or comparability factor was added. The CM sample shows a larger proportion of d15:S1 phenotype-like cells (~57%) and a smaller proportion of d30:S1 (mature cardiomyocyte-like) cells as compared to EHMs, supporting the notion that CMs continue maturation when being exposed to the 3D EHM environment88. The increase in duration of culture has been proposed to increase the maturity of the CMs, as also clearly evidenced by the deconvolution. It is also interesting to note that the deconvolution picked up the sparsity of non-cardiomyocyte-like cells in the CMs sample, only about ~9% of the sample is represented by the S2 sub-groups across both time-points, showing that the majority is composed by cardiomyocytes or cardiomyocytes-like cells. This clearly validates the current differentiation protocol. The difference in composition of the EHM samples from that of CMs is also captured efficiently as seen by the increase in proportion of S2 sub-groups (the non-contractile cells ) in the EHM samples. Figure 4.11: EHMs have a higher proportion of mature cardiomyocytes in comparison to CMs. A shows percentages of the various groups as per deconvolution, that are explained in B, along with a comparability factor added to the CM samples to allow for direct comparison of both CMs and EHMs. As explained in Section 1.6, our group envisions to conduct clinical trials employing the usage of EHMs for treatment of heart failure. Given that CMs are a key component in the production of EHMs, it is vital that the batch-to-batch consistency is maintained. Currently four batches of CMs have been analyzed in Figure 4.12 post bulk-sequencing and subsequent deconvolution. The variation across samples within proportions sub-groups is not signficant (Figure 4.12A). Each sample and its corresponding deconvoluted putative sub-group percentages are shown in Figure 4.12B. It is evident that the majority of any CM sample is accounted for by the d15:S2 (immature cardiomyocyte) phenotype (~ 83%) which is in-line with the evidences from functional and structural experiments of the group. Across every differentiation run, the efficiency of differentiation is assessed using flow cytometric markers, and percentage of cells positive for Actinin 2 marker indicate the approximate amount of cells differentiated into cardiomyocytes. In particular, one among the four samples was observed to have low percentages of Actinin positive cells (~40%), which was suspected to be an error in handling of the flow cytometer than actual lack of purity. The results from deconvolution show that indeed all the samples have a large proportion of cardiomyocytes (mean ~87%), and the single, potential outlier from flow cytometry data was possibly erroneous. Figure 4.12: The GMP-CM samples are mostly consistent wrt subpopulations derived from deconvolution. A shows the box plots of the contribution of four sub groups across the four samples. B is a sample-wise representation of the sub-groups. To see whether the difference observed between the two EHM sub-groups (in-house and from the project PRJNA362579) in PCA could be addressed using the deconvolution technique, a sample-level deconvolution was performed, as shown in Figure 4.13. It is seen that the EHM samples from project PRJNA362579 have a higher average percentage of mature-cardiomyocytes (d30:S2 ~ 23%) and more specifically, a sub group of the EHMs within it which the authors consider were more mature (~25%) due to differences in media supplementation (those labelled with MM medium). Those “mature” samples also have a higher combined percentage of d15:S1 and d30:S2 (i.e., all the cells committed to the cardiac lineage). The in-house samples show higher variation amongst the proportions of different sub-groups. This apparent consistency seen in the EHM samples from PRJNA362579, could be attributed to the fact that all these samples are from one study, primed for one hypothesis, while the in-house EHMs were sequenced across different years and different productions runs, along with changes in protocols. Yet, across the same cell-line or production batch, for instance the EHMs made from HES2 cell line, the consistency in putative sub populations are maintained. Figure 4.13: Differences in subpopulations amongst EHM samples. A shows the box-plots of percentage contributions of the various groups as per the source of the sample — in-house or from the PRJNA362579 project. B shows the corresponding sample-wise breakdown of the subpopulations in bulk data. 4.4.1 Limits of deconvolution To address the reliability of the deconvolution technique, all sample groups and all samples within all groups were included (iPSCs, fibroblasts, CMs, EHMs, adult and fetal heart) and were deconvolved using the same reference dataset, as shown in Figure 4.15. Initially the validity of the deconvolution was evaluated by creating three different pseudo bulk samples, with known proportions of the sub-groups from the single cell data and these bulk samples were then deconvoluted, see Figure 4.14. Here we see that the deconvolution recaptiulates the true proportions, with an average RMSE of 0.1. Figure 4.14: Estimating the validity of deconvolution. Three pseudobulk samples were created from the single cell reference data, the darker shade of the colours represent the known, true proportions of the four subgroups (denoted with a P). These samples were then deconvolved using CIBERSORTx and the resultant deconvolved estimated proportions are represented by the lighter shade bars adjacent to the true proportions. On the other hand, when we use samples irrelevant or different from the reference data set, we can see that all the groups were deconvolved, yet, the reliability of these results varied widely. For instance, the root mean squared error (RMSE)4 of iPSCs and Fibroblasts are close to 1.0 while that of fetal heart group is around 0.3 (Figure 4.15B) . The correlation of the deconvolved results to the actual reference sample also had a large range, 0.19 for iPSC and 0.84 for the fetal heart. This shows the biggest limitation of such deconvolution techniques, and probably stands testimonial to the “garbage in, garbage out” situation, is the fact that deconvolution would work in any setting, however the usability of it depends on the relevance and similarity in composition of the cell types of the reference and the bulk data that needs to be deconvolved. Figure 4.15: A shows the average deconvolution percentages of all groups to the four different subtypes. B shows the median RMSE of each group. Abbreviation: RMSE (root mean square error). 4.5 Basic characterisation of Rhesus Cardiomyocytes To see where the cardiomyocytes produced from rhesus-iPSCs were placed in comparison to the human-iPSCs cardiomyocytes, the RH-CM samples were sequenced and processed. These rhesus cardiomyocytes were produced to produce EHM patches which were then transferred to a heart failure model of non-primate rhesus models. After retaining only the 1:1 orthologous genes and accounting for variations in gene lengths, the resultant samples were visualized in a basic PCA plot (Figure 4.16). All the samples are separated according to the cell type, starting with the first PC separating stromal cells and cardiomyocytes while the second PC separating iPSCs from the rest. Here, the human cardiomyocytes and rhesus cardiomyocytes (denoted as RH-CM) cluster together, and further analysis using DE showed that most of these differences were due to non-cardiac factors such as differences in signalling pathways and neuronal components possibly due to the fact that the rhesus cardiomyocytes were induced using the same protocol used for human cells which does not account for the differences in intricacies in the signalling pathways between the two. Figure 4.16: PCA of different samples, iPSCs, fibroblasts, human CMs and rh-CMs show that the rhesus CMs cluster with the human CMs. References "],
["conclusion-and-future-work.html", "5 Conclusion and Future Work", " 5 Conclusion and Future Work Through this project we sought to explore the potential of RNA-Seq to contribute to the characterization of iPSC induced CMs and EHMs for clinical applications. This was achieved by firstly establishing a workflow to analyse the sequenced data and secondly by using a computational deconvolution technique to gain sub-population level knowledge from bulk data. The results obtained from computational deconvolution was a proof of principle wherein this digital cytometry technique, which has not yet been employed in this particular context, validated the current protocol used in the production of CMs and EHMs by the group by showing that CM samples are mostly (~91%) composed of either committed cardiac cells or cardiomycytes, while EHMs possess about ~35% of non-myocyte population. Also, within this, the CMs in the pure CM samples are less mature than their counterparts found in EHMs. This is in-line with the view that CMs tend to mature in a 3D environment like that of an EHM. These results were based on an input with known and defined cell types and shows a supervised learning methodology. Using PCA, an unsupervised technique, we showed that the majority of the variation across different groups containing CMs — namely, adult heart, fetal heart, EHM and CM samples, as captured by PC1 does not explain the biological differences in the their CM populations, and the differences are possibly due to tissue complexity. We also showed that using this deconvolution technique and an easy workflow, could possibly be used to follow the efficiency and consistency of differentiation across different runs and batches of production. A key reason for the possibility of using this consistently is due to the cheaper costs of bulk sequencing compared with single cell sequencing. Here, using computational deconvolution it is possible to obtain the benefits of single cell sequencing (i.e., knowing the subtypes of populations within a sample in our use case) using just bulk sequencing, saving on costs and time. This could also complement the standard FACS based methods of tracking differentiation. However, before this process becomes a regular part of quality control or characterization, limitations of the technique also need to be addressed, such as the fact that the results obtained by computational deconvolution is only as good as as the scRNA-Seq dataset. The potential granularity of information that can be obtained and its true revelance in deconvolution is mostly dependent on the scRNA-Seq reference dataset used. Thus, new and unknown cell-types can not be characterised or assessed using this technique, limiting its use in exploration or discovery. In this project, the scRNA-Seq reference used a protocol that is comparable and had the same end result, i.e., to produce CMs from iPSCs, yet, it is not exactly the same protocol used in-house. To make this really robust, comparable and of true value in monitoring the CMs or EHMs across different production runs, it would be prudent to produce a standarized in-house scRNA-Seq reference dataset. Evaluation of microbial contamination of engineered tissue in the context of clinical use is extensive and thorough, usually by microbiological methods. A part of the thesis also explored the presence of potential microbial contaminants using sequenced data. Here the results were in-line with most others’ findings in this area and demonstrated the non-standard use of RNA-Seq data in microbial detection. Incidently, spike-ins were detected and confirmed as a testament to the method employed. However, with this generality of usage comes the limitation of specificity. It possibly can not be a standalone way of microbial estimation/detection, and could possibly hint towards extreme cases which warrant deeper, more focused exploration. This was an exploratory analysis work and used data from varied sources none of which were aimed particularly for the questions asked in this project, for instance, the experimental design and the choices therein, sample sizes, replicates etc., were not all the same nor for the chosen question. Although measures were applied to avoid potential batch effects (samples that were sequenced across different time points, different instruments, different depths), it still remains a limitation to consider. In summary, we demonstrated the potential of using computational deconvolution techniques to gain sub-population level information in bulk data and its possible role in aiding the refinement, quality control of the protocols to produce iPSC-induced CMs and EHMs. "],
["summary.html", "Summary Task At Hand Work Done", " Summary Task At Hand Targeted differentiation of hypoimmunogenic iPSCs into functional cell types and subsequent assembly into artificial tissues for organ repair and replacement holds great potential to overcome the current donor organ shortage. The main aim of the project was to find putative sub-populations within samples of iPSC-induced cardiomyocytes and EHMs. In transcriptomics, this is addressed using single cell RNA sequencing, yet, at the time of the start of thesis there was data only from bulk RNA sequencing. Here a Computational Deconvolution approach seemed capable of providing sub-population level information from bulk sequencing using a relevant single cell dataset. Parts of thesis also focused explored the possibilty of using RNA sequencing data to identify potential microbial contaminants, as Prof. Zimmermann’s group and their work is transitioning into the clinics and as such, would need to meet the highest of standards of current Good Manufacturing Practices, a part of which deals with minimising, and checking for microbial contamination. Work Done An analysis pipeline was set up to analyse the bulk RNA sequencing data from raw sequencing files to count files, from which further analysis can be easily performed. Possible microbial contamination was investigated using the alignment of unmapped (to human genome) reads to bacterial and viral genomes. An exploratory data analysis was done and global trends were established which reiterated the group’s previous findings. For example, using PCA across multiple datasets we confirmed that the cardiomyocytes within the adult heart, fetal heart, EHMs and iPSC-cardiomyocytes were globally similar and the majority of the differences between these groups are possibily based on their tissue complexity. Putative proportions of sub-populations within the iPSC-induced cardiomyocytes and EHMs was established using computatinal deconvolution. The findings corroborated with the current differentiation and production protocols. "],
